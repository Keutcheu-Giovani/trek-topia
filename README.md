# Trektopia Landing Page

Trektopia Landing Page is a static web application designed to showcase my front-end development skills. It presents a conceptual climbing app called Trektopia, highlighting key features such as many new locations every month, technology using augmented reality, the ability to set an adventure schedule, and offline access to real maps.

## Features

- Many New Locations Every Month: Trektopia Landing Page emphasizes the concept of regularly adding new climbing locations, demonstrating the potential for climbers to explore a diverse range of exciting destinations.

- Technology Using Augmented Reality: The landing page showcases the use of augmented reality (AR) technology in the climbing app. By leveraging AR, climbers can experience an immersive and interactive climbing adventure, visualizing routes, obstacles, and challenges in real-world environments.

- Set An Adventure Schedule: Trektopia Landing Page highlights the ability of the app to enable climbers to plan and schedule their climbing adventures. Users can easily create personalized schedules, set goals, and track their progress, enhancing their overall climbing experience.

- Real Maps Can Be Offline: The landing page emphasizes the convenience of offline access to real maps within the Trektopia app. Climbers can rely on these maps even in areas with limited or no internet connectivity, ensuring they can navigate their routes effectively.
